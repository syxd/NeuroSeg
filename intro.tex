\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

%Reconstruction of neuronal morphology is important for brain studies. 
Obtaining a blue print of the brain architecture, including the morphologies and interconnectivities of neuronal populations, allows for measuring and visualizing neuronal structure, understanding neuronal identity, and determining potential connectivity.
Therefore, complete reconstruction of neuronal populations from large-scale brain images is essential to investigate the mechanism of the nervous system, analyze brain changes, and facilitate our understanding of brain diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease~\cite{Petrella2003, Giorgio2013}.
One of the key techniques in this endeavor is optical microscopy (OM), which allows detailed visualization of neurons and makes the reconstruction of every neuron possible~\cite{Senft2011}, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:brain}.
However, despite numerous efforts devoted, this task is still one of the main challenges in computational neuroscience.

The challenges in large-scale neuronal population reconstruction are mainly caused by complex morphology of neurons, low quality and large volume of OM brain images.
Due to the complicated process of imaging acquisition and the uneven distribution of fluorescence markers in neurons, the intensities of voxels that are occupied by neurons vary dramatically in highly noisy and inhomogeneous environments.
Moreover, to detail the structure of neurons in the brain, high resolution of OM images are required. Such an image typically contains trillions of voxels and the image size is formidably large in a terabyte scale. It is even impractical to directly load the entire large image into computer memory before reconstructing neurons when considering the memory cost and tracing time.
Manual reconstruction of neuronal populations from large-scale brain images is an extremely laborious and time-consuming task.
Sophisticated knowledge of neuron morphology is also required.
%
Therefore, an effective and automatic reconstruction algorithm for large-scale neuronal population in these challenging situations is greatly desired in practice.
 % 
Attempts have been made for neuron reconstruction for large-scale OM images in recent years, such as Neuron Crawler~\cite{Zhou2015}, \md{UltraTracer~\cite{Peng2017} and MEIT~\cite{Wang2018}}.
A common solution is to divide the large-scale image into blocks and trace neurons block by block.
Despite their great improvement in this task, several limitations still remain.


One main bottleneck is that the base tracers used for neuron tracing in image blocks typically \md{employ a series of traditional image processing algorithms such as binarinzation, fast marching, fusion, etc. }
Unfortunately, these algorithms using hand-crafted features and rules have difficulty in reconstructing neurons from low-contrast and noisy image blocks.
To improve the reconstruction quality, deep learning techniques have been adopted in neuron reconstruction recently~\cite{Xu2016, Li2017, Zhou2018}. 
However, these approaches require huge amount of manually annotated data for neuron segmentation network training.
%
We observe that the reconstruction maps inferred from existing conventional algorithms can effectively provide approximate locations of neurons. 
Although these voxels may not cover all neurons, they still provide important cues for obtaining complicated patterns of neurons.
Therefore, we propose a progressive learning scheme for neuronal population reconstruction (PLNPR) to take advantage of both conventional methods and deep learning techniques.
More specifically, we employ conventional methods to produce pseudo-labels to train a deep segmentation network. 
The network is expected to learn more comprehensive features of neurons from noisy labels. 
With a more powerful network for segmenting neurons, the neuron reconstruction using conventional tracers could be improved. 
Then we progressively refine the network with better neuron reconstruction results as pseudo labels, and reconstruct more complete neurons with better neuron segmentation.
We first investigate this concept in our preliminary work \cite{Zhao2019} on a few image blocks. 
In this work, we apply PLNPR on dense neuron population reconstruction in a ultra-scale OM image slice. 

Another bottleneck of existing large-scale neuron reconstruction methods~\cite{Zhou2015, Peng2017, Wang2018} is that they mainly focus on single neuron reconstruction. 
%
For dense neuronal population reconstruction in large-scale OM images, dense neurites may cross with each other, which makes the neuron tracing much more challenging in low-contrast and noisy OM images. 
% 
Following the commonly used block-by-block framework, we introduce UltraNPR, which utilizes our PLNPR approach as the base tracer in blocks, and \md{design a novel tracing strategy with a fusion algorithm for dense neuronal populations}.
%
For dense neuronal population reconstruction, we start local reconstruction using our PLNPR in the blocks where soma can be detected, and propagate a group of neurite tips as pseudo somas for neighboring blocks to trace the neuronal population. 
%
There are typically over-tracing and topological discrepancy in the reconstructed neurites in adjacent blocks. 
Therefore, we design a spatial weighted neurite fusion method to trust the neurites in the middle of block more than those in the boundary region.   


In summary, we propose a general progressive learning framework that can integrate existing neuron tracing and deep segmentation networks for neuron reconstruction without using manual annotations.
%
We integrate our PLNPR with a block-wise propagation and fusion strategy which can reconstruct dense neuronal populations from trillions of voxels in an image slice. 
%
In order to evaluate our method, we build a dataset ``VISoR-40" which consists of 40 OM image blocks from mouse cortical regions. Manual annotations of eight blocks in the dataset are available for the community. 
Extensive experiments on our VISoR-40 dataset and the public BigNeuron dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our progressive learning algorithm for both neuronal population reconstruction and single neuron reconstruction.




%In this work, we introduce UltraNPR, an algorithm designed for reconstructing dense neuronal populations from large-scale or even ultra-large-scale images. UltraNPR reconstructs neuronal populations by progressively improving the completeness of neuronal structure block by block.
%
\delete{Firstly, the large-scale raw image is divided into blocks of the same size.
Since somas are where signals from the dendrites are joined and pass on, UltraNPR begins the reconstruction from the blocks that contain somas.
% which can be detected using existing soma detection methods.
For robust reconstruction from low-quality images, our PLNPR method is applied to trace neurons in each block.
Based on the reconstruction results in already-reconstructed blocks, UltraNPR automatically and adaptively searches the next block to trace.
%For each block containing somas, this reconstruction procedure repeats until no new terminal tips could be detected or the next block contains somas.
%Finally, UltraNPR analyzes the reconstruction results in all blocks, and assembles the matched neurites from adjacent blocks to obtain the final complete neuronal population reconstruction. In our implementation, 
Finally, a fusion algorithm is designed to make the fragmented neurites of a neuron from adjacent blocks can be assembled continuously and smoothly.
In this way, UltraNPR is capable of exploring a large-scale image for neuronal population reconstruction.
