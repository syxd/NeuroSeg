Given a large-scale noisy OM image, we follow a block-by-block neruon reconstruction scheme, as Fig.~\ref{fig:ultra_framework} shows. 
%
The ultra-scale input image may contain billions or even trillions of voxels.
We first divide the input image into blocks that are averagely in size of $0.5mm\times 1mm\times \textbf{0.25}mm$ with some \textbf{overlaps}. 
%
For each block, we first enhance the noisy images by a deep neural network, which is progressively trained from reconstructed neurons using traditional tracing algorithms. 
Then we reconstruct multiple neurons in each block using the enhanced image. 
%
Since it is more reliable to start from somas rather than subtle neurites for neuron reconstruction, our UltraNPR employs an effective block propagation strategy to trace dense neuronal populations in an adaptive order. 
Finally, we fuse overlapped neurites in adjacent blocks to reconstruct complete neuronal populations for the whole ultra-scale image.}

\subsection{PLNPR for Robust Neuron Reconstruction}
%\subsection{Unsupervised Progressive Learning for Neuronal Population Reconstruction}
\label{sec:PLNPR}



To reconstruct neurons in a noisy OM image block, our PLNPR algorithm consists of three key components: a segmentation network, an image enhancement module and a neuron tracing module, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:framework}. 
%
The segmentation network is designed to extract neuron voxels from noisy and complex backgrounds.
Compared with existing segmentation networks are trained with dense voxel-wise annotations for strong supervision, we use pseudo labels that are generated using traditional neuron tracing methods.
%
In each iteration of segmentation and reconstruction, we apply the NGPST~\cite{Quan2015} as the neuron tracing module to reconstruct neurons from image blocks. 
The tracing module can be replaced by any other tracing method that does not require manual annotations for training.
%
It takes an image block $\mathbf{B}$ as input and reconstructs a neuronal population with separated neurons.
%The intensity $\mathbf{I}(x)$ of a voxel $x$ belongs to $[0,1]$.
From the reconstruction results, we produce a binary mask $\mathbf{M}$ indicating foreground by $\mathbf{M}(x)=1$ and background by $\mathbf{M}(x)=0$ for a voxel $x$.


Given $N$ unlabeled image blocks, we train our segmentation network using the neuron masks $\{\mathbf{M}_i, i=1,\cdots,N\}$ generated from the neuron tracing module.
%
The output of the neuron segmentation network is a 3D probability map $\mathbf{P}$, which is computed by a voxel-wise softmax activation function. $\mathbf{P}(x)\in [0,1]$ indicating the probability of a voxel $x$ to be a neuron part.
%
Then, by fusing the predicted probability map with the raw signals, the image block is enhanced in order to preserve both local signals and global structures simultaneously.
When the enhanced block is fed into the neuron tracing module, more complete neuronal populations can be reconstructed and provide better pseudo labels for the next iteration of network training. 
%
Based on the iterative learning process, the powerful DNNs and tracing methods mutually complement and promote each other to gradually improve the neuron reconstruction performance.


 

\subsubsection{DNN for 3D Neuron Segmentation}
\label{sec:network}
 
Extracting neuron voxels from image blocks is not a trivial problem since the size, morphology and intensity of neurons vary significantly.
In recent years, many 3D DNNs, such as 3D U-Net~\cite{Cicek2016}, 3D DSN~\cite{Dou2017} and DenseVoxNet~\cite{Yu2017} have demonstrated an outstanding capability in various biological and biomedical image segmentation tasks.
%Therefore, we take advantage of 3D segmentation networks to extract more representative features to meet the challenges of neuron segmentation.
We extend the 3D DSN~\cite{Dou2017} as our neuron segmentation network to balance the performance and computation burden.
%
Although the original 3D DSN has achieved excellent performance for 3D organ segmentation~\cite{Dou2017}, it is still prone to overfitting in our case due to the limited training data. 
We employ the dropout~\cite{Srivastava2014} technique during training to learn more robust features that better generalize to new data.
In each convolutional layer, the dropout with a rate of $0.5$ is applied in our network. 



Another challenge of training 3D DNN is the memory limitation because the 3D feature images are huge with respect to the input size. Therefore, for each input image block, we crop a group of small cubes in size of $160\times 160\times 160$ with $30\%$ overlaps, and set batch size to 1 during training. 
%
To have the same physical resolution with the lateral dimension in OM image blocks, voxels in the axial dimension are interpolated after the imaging process. However, this interpolation makes the image quality along different dimensions inhomogeneous. 
Therefore, a random transposition process is employed for each cube as data augmentation for network training.

%Correspondingly, at the test time, we stitch these overlapped probability cubes together using average blending to get a probability map in the same size with the input block.

In addition, the volume of neuron voxels is usually much smaller than that of background in an OM image.
A data balancing technique is employed for network training.
When computing the training loss, we only consider the neuron voxels and a certain portion of background voxels, which is randomly selected as non-neuron samples.
The number of non-neuron voxels used for training is set as $10$ times that of neuron voxels.


\subsubsection{Image Enhancement}
\label{sec:enhancement}

After training the segmentation network using pseudo labels, the trained model is used to predict a probability map for each image cube. 
By averaging the probabilities of the overlapped voxels between adjacent cubes, we can obtain the probability map $\mathbf{P}$ for the entire block $\mathbf{B}$.
Each element in $\mathbf{P}$ indicates the probability of the corresponding voxel in $\mathbf{B}$ being a neuron voxel.
To utilize the probability map, one natural way is to reconstruct neurons directly from it.
However, since the pseudo labels are not as accurate as manual annotations, especially at the early iterations, some local details might lose in the probability map. Therefore, we employ an enhanced representation by fusing the probability map and the raw image block, in order to keep detailed structures and suppress noise signals effectively.
Specifically, a new probability map $\widetilde{\mathbf{P}} $ is first constructed by linearly mapping the value range of $ \mathbf{P}\in [0,1] $ to the value range $[{b}_{min}, {b}_{max}]$ of $\mathbf{B}$ as
\begin{equation}
\widetilde{\mathbf{P}}(x) = ({b}_{max}-{b}_{min})\mathbf{P}(x).
\end{equation}


Then, an enhanced block $\mathbf{E}$ is computed as
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E}(x) = \alpha\widetilde{\mathbf{P}}(x) + (1-\alpha)\mathbf{B}(x),
\label{equ: enhance}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha\in [0,1]$ is a weight to control the contributions of voxel $ x $ in the original intensity and the probability map. By feeding the enhanced blocks to the neuron tracing module, neuronal populations can be reconstructed more completely.


With more reliable reconstruction results for supervision, the segmentation network could be further trained to learn more discriminative and representative features for producing probability maps, which in turn benefits the tracing module to reconstruct neurons in the next iteration.
%
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ngps}(a), due to the noises and low contrast in the raw image block, the intensity of neuron voxels is inhomogeneous.
At first, by feeding the raw image to the conventional method~\cite{Quan2015}, a neuronal population can be reconstructed. However, compared to the ground truth (GT) shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ngps}(k), the reconstructed neuronal population is incomplete and many neurites are missing, as Fig.~\ref{fig:ngps}(g) shows.
Then, by utilizing the pseudo labels derived from imperfect reconstruction, the segmentation network can be trained to learn features for global trajectories. Fig.~\ref{fig:ngps}(b) shows the predicted probability map, which demonstrates the enhanced trajectories.
With more iterations of neuron reconstruction and network training, more distinctive and long-range trajectory features can be progressively captured by the network, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ngps}(c)(d)(e).
By combining the original image intensities with the predicted probability map, both local signal details and global trajectories are well preserved in the enhanced block, as Fig.~\ref{fig:ngps}(f) shows.
Iteration by iteration, the completeness and accuracy of neuron reconstruction are progressively improved, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ngps}(h)(i)(j).

	\label{fig:blocksearch}
\end{figure}


Our PLNPR enhances the image \md{signals} and traces neurons \md{from} each image block.
However, neurons usually exist across multiple blocks in an ultra-scale image. 
% 
We propose an effective stitching process by looking for the most continuous block to trace dense neuron populations from multiple neighboring blocks. 
%
As somas are where signals from the dendrites are joined and pass on, we start from reconstructing neurons in the blocks where somas can be detected.
For blocks where no soma can be detected, we trace the neurons by generating pseudo-somas from the neurite tips from their neighboring blocks. 
%
Finally, the neurites reconstructed \md{from} local blocks are fused to get complete neurons. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:ultra_framework} shows the pipeline of our UltraNPR approach. 
%Our UltraNPR consists of four components: a soma detection module, a block reconstruction module, a block search module, and a neurite fusion module, as shown in


%\subsubsection{Initial Soma Detection}
%\label{sec:soma}
 %
 %For each block $B_{i}$, we get a set of somas.
 % $\hat{S}_i = s_{ik}, k=1,\ldots,M_{i} $. 
 %Each soma $ s_{ik} $ is represented by its center $ (x,y,z) $ and radius $ r $.
\delete{
We apply the soma detection algorithm~\cite{Quan2013} on each block in an ultra-scale image separately. 
Due to the overlap between blocks, somas in the overlapped area would be detected repeatedly.
We merge the overlapping somas in adjacent blocks by averaging their positions and radius and get a set of somas in the entire image, \md{as shown in Fig.~4 of the supplementary file.} 
}
%The soma detection results from the large-scale image are visualized in Fig.~{4} of the supplementary file.
%These somas are also used to define the initial blocks for neuron reconstruction in the next step.

\subsubsection{Block Reconstruction and Propagation}
\label{sec:trace}


 
We apply the soma detection algorithm~\cite{Quan2013} on each block in an ultra-scale image separately. 
If a block $B_{i}$ contains somas, we apply our PLNPR to reconctruct neurites and get a set of neurites $\mathcal{N}_{i}$ in this block, as shown by the blocks in yellow frames in Fig.~\ref{fig:blocksearch}~(a).
For the remaining unreconstructed blocks, we check its neighboring blocks that have been reconstructed and add the neurite tips from the reconstructed blocks as its pseudo somas. 
%
Though NGPST can perform neuron tracing without any somas, it typically fails to distinguish multiple neurons with dense neurites, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ngpst_pseudosoma}(a).
%
In order to avoid under-segmentation of neurons, we follow the neuron structure in the blocks that have been traced by setting their neurite tips as pseudo somas for NGPST in the unreconstructed block.
%
Therefore, for each iteration of our block propagation, the unreconstructed block $B^*$ which has the largest number of neighboring reconstructed blocks and the largest number of pseudo somas is selected for reconstruction next.
%
More specifically, for each neighboring reconstructed block of $B^*$, we collect the neuronal \md{points} that are close to the boundary of $B^*$, and use them as the pseudo-somas for growing the neuronal structure in $B^*$.
After that, we get its neurites set $ \mathcal{N}^*$.
Fig.~\ref{fig:blocksearch} shows the block propagation and reconstruction process of ten neighboring blocks. 
%(b)(c) show two examples of unreconstructed blocks (red) that to be traced from its neighboring blocks (yellow) that have been reconstructed. 
%
This block reconstruction and propagation process continues iteratively until all the blocks have been reconstructed in an ultra-scale image. 
%

\subsubsection{Neurite Fusion in Adjacent Blocks}
\label{sec:fusion}


\begin{figure}[b]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{./Illustrations/fusion_errors.pdf}
	\caption{An example of over-tracing (yellow) and topological discrepancy (red) when assembling two overlapped neurites. These reconstructions are shown in skeleton mode for better visualization.}
	\label{fig:overlap_discrepancy}
\end{figure}
Since neurons would be split into fragmented neurites when dividing the raw image into blocks, we now fuse the neurites from adjacent blocks that are reconstructed separately into connected and complete neurons.
Given the reconstructed neurite sets $\mathcal{N}_a$ and $\mathcal{N}_b$ in two overlapped blocks $\mathbf{B}_a$ and $\mathbf{B}_b$ respectively, for each neurite ${N}_{a}\in \nset_{a}$, we look for the neurite ${N}_{b}\in \nset_{b}$ which has the largest overlap with ${N}_{a}$. 
If the overlap volume between them is larger than a threshold $\delta_{ovlp}$, we fuse these two neurites together to get a complete neuron.

There might be over-tracing and topological discrepancy between two neurites that are reconstructed in two blocks separately, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:overlap_discrepancy}.
Generally, the reconstruction quality near the block boundary is less accurate and reliable than that in the middle of blocks because of less context. 
Therefore, when fusing two neurites, we tend to keep the neurite segments in the middle of blocks as following. 
%But this region is inside the adjacent block due to the overlap between them, which means substantial context information of this region can be provided to the tracing methods and leads to a better reconstruction.
%Therefore, when assembling two matched neurites from adjacent blocks, we only consider neuronal \md{points} which are not near the boundary of the corresponding block. 
  
For two matched neurites, we select the longer one as the reference neurite $N_a$, and merge the other neurite $N_b$ to the reference neurite, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fusion_algorithm} (b).
%
Each neurite is decomposed to a set of neurite branches, as Fig.~\ref{fig:fusion_algorithm} (c) shows.
Each branch is sampled uniformly into a set of \md{fragments}, as Fig.~\ref{fig:fusion_algorithm} (d) shows.
%
For each branch of neurite $N_b$, we search the branch which has the largest overlapped volume with it in the reference neurite $N_a$, as Fig~\ref{fig:fusion_algorithm} (f) shows.
To fuse the matched two branches, for each point $p_a$ in the branch $F_a$, if $p_a$ lies in the boundary region of block $\blk_a$ ($\delta_{bound}$ voxels to the block boundary of $\blk_a$), it will be removed and all its child branches are also deleted, as shown in Fig~\ref{fig:fusion_algorithm} (g).  
The same deletion operation is performed on the points on branches in $N_b$ that are located in the boundary regions of block $\blk_b$.


Then, for each remaining point $p_b$ in branch $\brc_b$, if there is a point $p_a$ in branch $\brc_a$ so that $dis(p_b,p_a)<\beta$, it will be removed since the point $p_a$ is kept for the neurite, as Fig~\ref{fig:fusion_algorithm} (g) shows.
%
After that, the remaining part of branch $\brc_b$ is merged to the reference branch $\brc_a$ by connecting it to the nearest point in $\brc_a$.
After all matched branches are processed as above, we can obtain the fused neurite $N_{ab}$.
%
For the remaining branches in $N_b$ which are not fused to any branches in $N_a$, they will be merged to the fused neurite $N_{ab}$ by connecting each of them to the nearest point in $N_{ab}$.
%
Fig~\ref{fig:fusion_algorithm} (h) shows the final fusion result of the two neurites. 
By fusing all neurites in two adjacent blocks, we can obtain more complete reconstruction of dense neuronal populations, as shown in Fig~\ref{fig:fusion_algorithm} (e).
