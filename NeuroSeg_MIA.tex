\begin{abstract}
Reconstruction of neuronal populations from large-scale optical microscopy (OM) brain images is essential to investigate neuronal circuits and brain mechanisms.
To mitigate the impact of low quality of images on neuron reconstruction, some studies have been conducted to extract neuron voxels using deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, training such a DNN usually relies on a large number of images with voxel-wise annotations, which is very costly to obtain in terms of both finance and labor.
In this paper, we propose an \md{unsupervised} progressive learning framework for robust neuron reconstruction free of manual annotations. Our framework consists of a neuron tracing module and a segmentation network, which mutually complement and progressively promote each other.
Based on the progressively learned model, reconstructing neurons from local noisy image blocks is feasible with allowed memory.
To reconstruct neuronal populations from a terabyte-sized large-scale image, we introduce a new automatic reconstruction algorithm by adaptively tracing neurons block by block and assembling individual neurons continuously and smoothly.

We build a dataset called ``VISoR-40" that consists of 40 OM image blocks from mouse cortical regions. Extensive experimental results on our VISoR-40 dataset and the public BigNeuron dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method for neuronal population reconstruction and single neuron reconstruction, respectively.
Furthermore, we successfully apply our method to the reconstruction of dense neuronal populations in a large-scale mouse brain slice.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we propose PLNPR, an \md{unsupervised} progressive learning framework for neuronal population reconstruction from noisy and low-quality OM image blocks.
Without using any manual annotations, we take advantage of neuron tracing techniques and deep segmentation networks, and make them mutually complement and promote each other progressively.
We extensively validate the proposed PLNPR for neuron reconstruction and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.
%This framework can progressively train a deep segmentation network for extracting neuron voxels without using any manual an5421`notations. 
%We extensively validate the proposed 3D DSN on two distinct applications and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed network.
Furthermore, we introduce UltraNPR, a reconstruction algorithm that makes possible the neuronal population reconstruction from large-scale OM brain images.
We also construct a new neuron dataset ``VISoR-40'' which consists of $ 40 $ OM image blocks for the evaluation of neuronal population reconstruction.
This dataset will be published to facilitate further work on brain research, including but not limited to neuron counting, neuron reconstruction and neuron morphology analysis, and so on.
